I"K<p>Since I have some free time due to coronavirus outbreak I have made some modifications here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Style changes: Now the page is not <em>“full-dark”</em> and other minor changes.</li>
  <li>I have added the photography secction.</li>
  <li>I have added pagination to the blog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also I want to start writing regularly. Until now this page only received updates once or twice per year, and maybe is a good time to give a litle bit of life to this blog. It is just a thought, don’t kill me if I don’t do it :P</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>
