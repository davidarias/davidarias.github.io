Welcome to my new home page! Here you may find information about myself and my hobbies,
including coding, heavy metal and Star Wars, all combined in an awesome mix of nerdiness :D
Soon ( I hope ) I'll upload some projects I'm woking on right now.

If you are curious about this site, is built with [Jekyll][jekyll] ( a static website generator ) and hosted
in [Github][github].


I think that's all for the monent. Thank you for visiting my site!
